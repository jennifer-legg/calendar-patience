      <h2>Rules for clock patience</h2>
      <p>
        Each of the pile of cards placed in the circle relates to the numbers on
        an analog clock. To play, you must click to turn a card and then drag it
        to the corresponding pile.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>
        Number cards should go under the corresponding hour - for example, cards
        with the value &#39;5&#39; should go under the five o&#39;clock
        position.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>
        Aces should be dragged to one o&#39;clock, Jacks to 11 o&#39;clock,
        Queens to 12 o&#39;clock, and Kings to the center.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>
        Once placed in the correct pile, the top card on that pile will be ready
        to turn.
      </p>
      <p>
        To win, you must turn over all of the cards in the outside clock and
        place them in the correct position, without all of the kings in the
        center pile being turned over.
      </p>
      <p>
        If four kings have been revealed before you have turned over all of the
        cards in the piles around the outside of the clock, the game is over and
        you lose.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>Good luck!</p>
